Shortest Sub-segment
====================

Given a paragraph of text, write a program to find the first shortest sub-segment that contains each of the given k words at least once. A segment is said to be shorter than other if it contains less number of words.

Ignore characters other than [a-z][A-Z] in the text. Comparison between the strings should be case-insensitive. 

If no sub-segment is found then the program should output “NO SUBSEGMENT FOUND”.

 
Input format :
 
First line of the input contains the text.
Next line contains k , the number of  words given to be searched.
Each of the next k lines contains a word.
 
 
Output format :
 
Print first shortest sub-segment that contains given k words , ignore special characters, numbers.If no sub-segment is found it should return “NO SUBSEGMENT FOUND”
 
Sample Input :
 
This is a test. This is a programming test. This is a programming test in any language.
4
this
a
test
programming
 
Sample Output :
 
a programming test This
 
Explanation :
In this test case segment "a programming test. This" contains given four words. You have to print without special characters, numbers so output is "a programming test This".  Another segment "This is a programming test." also contains given  four words but have more number of words. 
 
Constraint :

Total number of character in a paragraph will not be more than 200,000.
0 < k <= no. of words in paragraph.
0 < Each word length < 15




Meeting Schedules
=================

Given M busy-time slots of N people, You need to print all the available time slots when all the N people can schedule a meeting for a duration of K minutes.
Event time will be of form HH MM ( where 0 <= HH <= 23 and 0 <= MM <= 59 ), K will be in the form minutes.
 
Input Format:
 
M K [ M number of busy time slots , K is the duration in minutes ]
Followed by M lines with 4 numbers on each line.
Each line will be of form StartHH StartMM EndHH EndMM  [ Example 9Am-11Am time slot will be given as 9 00 11 00 ]
An event time slot is of form [Start Time, End Time ) . Which means it inclusive at start time but doesn’t include the end time. 
So an event of form 10 00  11 00 => implies that the meeting start at 10:00 and ends at 11:00, so another meeting can start at 11:00.
 
Sample Input:
5 120
16 00 17 00
10 30 14 30
20 45 22 15
10 00 13 15
09 00 11 00
 
Sample Output:
00 00 09 00
17 00 20 45
 
Sample Input:
8 60
08 00 10 15
22 00 23 15
17 00 19 00
07 00 09 45
09 00 13 00
16 00 17 45
12 00 13 30
11 30 12 30
 
Sample Output:
00 00 07 00
13 30 16 00
19 00 22 00
 
Constraints :
1 <= M <= 100
 
Note: 24 00 has to be presented as 00 00.


Fibonacci Factor
================

Given a number K, find the smallest Fibonacci number that shares a common factor( other than 1 ) with it. A number is said to be a common factor of two numbers if it exactly divides both of them. 
 
Output two separate numbers, F and D, where F is the smallest fibonacci number and D is the smallest number other than 1 which divides K and F.
 
Input Format 
 
First line of the input contains an integer T, the number of testcases.
Then follows T lines, each containing an integer K.
 
Output Format
 
Output T lines, each containing the required answer for each corresponding testcase.
 
 

 

Sample Input 
 
3
3
5
161
 
Sample Output
 
3 3
5 5
21 7
 
Explanation
 
There are three testcases. The first test case is 3, the smallest required fibonacci number  3. The second testcase is 5 and the third is 161. For 161 the smallest fibonacci numer sharing a common divisor with it is 21 and the smallest number other than 1 dividing 161 and 7 is 7.
 
Constraints :
 
1 <= T <= 5
2 <= K <= 1000,000
The required fibonacci number is guranteed to be less than 10^18.


Connected Sets
==============

Given a 2–d matrix , which has only 1’s and 0’s in it. Find the total number of connected sets in that matrix.
 
 
Explanation:
Connected set can be defined as group of cell(s) which has 1 mentioned on it and have at least one other cell in that set with which they share the neighbor relationship. A cell with 1 in it and no surrounding neighbor having 1 in it can be considered as a set with one cell in it. Neighbors can be defined as all the cells adjacent to the given cell in 8 possible directions ( i.e N , W , E , S , NE , NW , SE , SW direction ). A cell is not a neighbor of itself.
 
 
Input format :
 
First line of the input contains T , number of test-cases.
Then follow T testcases. Each testcase has given format.
N [ representing the dimension of the matrix N X N ].
Followed by N lines , with N numbers on each line.
 
 
 
Ouput format :
 
For each test case print one line ,  number of connected component it has.
 
Sample Input :
 
4
